## Introduction
The GreenDocAI project utilizes deep learning models to provide innovative solutions in green technology. This project is a group effort as part of the curriculum for the Master's in Business Analytics at Nova School of Business and Economics.

## Project Objectives
- To explore the application of deep learning in green technology.
- To develop a model that can predict or classify data related to green technology.
- To analyze the performance of the model and provide insights.

## Methodology
The project follows a structured approach:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant datasets for training and testing the model.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Model Development**: Building and training the deep learning model.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using various metrics.
5. **Deployment**: Deploying the model for practical use.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes images of tomato plants. The data was sourced from various agricultural databases and contains thousands of records with multiple features, focusing on identifying different types of diseases in tomato plants.

## Model
The model developed for this project is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The key components of the model include:
- Input layers for image data
- Multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Fully connected layers for classification

## Models_GreenDoc.ipynb
The `Models_GreenDoc.ipynb` notebook contains the model code and comparisons for GreenDocAI. It includes:
- The implementation of various deep learning models used for disease classification in tomato plants.
- Detailed explanations of each model architecture and their respective components.
- Comparison of model performance metrics to determine the best-performing model.

This notebook also lists the diseases that the model is trained to identify, including:
- Powdery Mildew
- Late Blight
- Septoria Leaf Spot
- Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus
- Early Blight
- Target Spot
- Leaf Mold
- Tomato Mosaic Virus
- Bacterial Spot
- Spider Mites (Two-spotted Spider Mite)

## Results
The model achieved significant accuracy in identifying and classifying different diseases in tomato plants. Performance metrics include:
- **Accuracy**: 90%
- **Precision**: 88%
- **Recall**: 87%
- **F1 Score**: 88%
